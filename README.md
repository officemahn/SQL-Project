# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My primary goal for this project is to transform a raw dataset into a clean and structured database using industry-standard tools and practices. The objective is to ensure that the resulting database is in a format that is not only usable but also capable of providing valuable insights for making informed decisions.


## Process
### (Step 1): In the initial step, I started by exploring the data. This allowed me to gain understanding of the raw data, identifying data types, distributions, missing values, and potential issues. This exploration allowed me to form a clear picture of the dataset and its quality.

### (Step 2): In this step I began data cleaning. It included handling missing data, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, ensuring data type consistency, and applying necessary data transformations. 

### (Step 3): Once the data cleaning process was complete, I began trying to answer some questions about the data set such as what the highest selling product was, or the highest order in a city. I was able to join tables and answer questions about the dataset.


### (Step 4): After answering questions on the dataset. I needed to verify the accuracy of the results. This step involved verifying the accuracy and integrity of the cleaned data. I checked for data consistency and correctnesss. 

### (Step 5): After validating the cleaned data, I tested it with sample queries and analyzed to ensure that it produced the expected results. 


## Results
The resulting clean database now enables me to gain valuable insights into visitors, products, countries, and product categories. It also enables me to provide answers to questions the business owneer may have.  This structured data can be leveraged to answer a wide range of questions about the users and visitors of the site, which cities have the highest sales, which products are top sellers, and many other critical insights. The data can be combined in numerous ways to provide well-informed answers and support data-driven decision-making.

## Challenges 
One of the significant challenges I initially faced was the constraint of time and the feeling of being overwhelmed when confronted with the datasets. However, I successfully overcame these challenges by carefully planning the data cleaning process and gradually diving into the project. As a result, I gained confidence in working with the data and providing meaningful answers.

## Future Goals
While the data has been significantly cleaned and transformed, there is always room for further improvement. I now understand why data cleaning is a time-consuming but essential part of a data analyst's role. Clean data is a fundamental prerequisite for meaningful analysis and decision-making. In the future, I aim to continue refining the data and ensuring its accuracy and quality.One of the significant challenges I initially faced was the constraint of time and the feeling of being overwhelmed when confronted with the datasets.
